# ragpromt: Log Anomaly Detection with RAG (Retriever Augmented Generation)

![RAGPromt Logo](link-to-logo.png)

## Overview

ragpromt is an open-source project designed for detecting anomalies in log data using the power of large language models, specifically leveraging RAG (Retriever Augmented Generation). This tool combines retriever models to efficiently retrieve relevant information from logs and generation models to identify anomalies, providing a robust solution for log anomaly detection.

## Features

- **RAG Integration**: Utilize the power of RAG to improve anomaly detection accuracy.
- **Log Retrieval**: Efficiently retrieve relevant log data using retriever models.
- **Anomaly Generation**: Leverage generation models to identify and flag anomalies in log entries.
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Fine-tune detection thresholds to adapt to specific use cases.

## Installation

bash
pip install ragpromt
